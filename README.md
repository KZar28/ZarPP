Classic Wow Rogue Pickpocket Counter

Counts te amount of gold/silver/copper pickpocketed throughout a single session. Will add each sessions total and display total amount pickpocketed per character!

commands: 
```
/pp

Thats it!

Note: The counter uses the PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED flag to determine if its a normal looting event or a pickpocket, let me know if there's any issues!
